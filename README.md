I wrote a script using pandas for data management and folium for web mapping to visualize the volcanoes along the West Coast of the USA.
The map displays icons of varying colors based on the height of each volcano. When clicked, these icons provide information about the volcano and a hyperlink that search for the volcano's name on Google. Additionally, countries are color-coded according to their population.
